# HDDL Policy Rollout Visualization

This website provides a **visual representation** of the rollout of the **HDDL policy**, generated through the execution of the `run_hddl_policy.py` script.

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Run the following command to train the model:
  ```bash
  python3 main_train.py
  ```
- This script generates a trained model that will be used for the policy rollout.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Policy Rollout
- Execute the policy rollout with:
  ```bash
  python3 run_hddl_policy.py
  ```
- This script:
  - Loads the trained model from `main_train.py`.
  - Generates the results of the optimal policy rollout.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualizing the Rollout
- Navigate to the website directory (this directory):
  ```bash
  cd website
  ```
- Start a local HTTP server to view the rollout visualization:
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```
- Open your web browser and visit:
  [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
