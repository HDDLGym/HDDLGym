The Overcooked environment are converted into HDDL domain and problem files. The primitive actions in HDDL domain are not equivalent to the primitive actions in the Gym-based Overcooked. 

The HDDL Overcooked files are meant to use HDDLGym and find the high-level actions, in which can further be applied back to the original Overcooked game with A* motion planning method to get the primitive actions.

Details of hierarchical task networks are described in the HDDLGym paper.
